# Ghost Fly.io Starter

You will need a [Fly.io](https://fly.io/) account to get started. Run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/selfhosterco/ghost-flyio-starter.git && cd ./ghost-flyio-starter && sh ./setup.sh
```

That's it 👏 You will be prompted for input to set up the project, and 
a few minutes later the link to your blog will appear in your terminal. 
As a result, you will have your project launched and ready for version 
control using Git. The script will also produce a `secrets.txt` file 
that contains your MySQL credentials. Make sure to save it somewhere 
or you may lose access to your database.
